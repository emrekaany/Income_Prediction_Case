Finding Wealthy Customers


Hello There,
We need help finding wealthy customers for our new marketing campaign. Our target is customers with more than 50k dollars income each year.



We expect total of 2 million customers that fulfills the target out of the banks 21 million total customer base, but we are only sure about the 
income of these customers that you can find attached. We hope that you can find us a solution that can be used on the customers without income.


We tried to find as much information as possible about these customers you can find on the attached file. 
There may be some data trouble, but you can be sure that the income column is correct. The other information can be a bit old but the income column is up to date.

I hope you can return to us as soon as possible with a presentation about your solution. 
We are not data savvy so please give us details about what you did and reasons behind your work. 
Would be great if you could explain why your solution was good/bad and what we should expect when we use your solution on all the customers we don't have income information for. 

We tried our best to be detailed but please excuse us if we missed sharing any other important information. 
Feel free to ask us any questions you have but since we are busy with the new marketing campaign we only have time to answer three questions in total.
Looking forward to seeing your solution.
Best Regards, 
Ophelia Pane
